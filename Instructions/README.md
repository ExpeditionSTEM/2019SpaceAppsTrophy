INSTRUCTIONS

I have provided the Demo Code / sketch used during the Awards Ceremony of the 2019 Space Apps Huntsville event.  This demo sketch hits just about everything except for use of the SD card reader on the EPD and the bluetooth module on the Feather 32u4 bluefruit (due to memory space).

I will upload a YouTube video of how to use the demo sketch on the trophy when I get a chance.
